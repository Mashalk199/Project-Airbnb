Guide for my portfolio and personal projects:

1. **Natural Language Processing with job listings** | Gensim, NLTK, Regex Sept 2022 – Oct 2022

• Performed comprehensive natural language processing on a job listings dataset, using regex to clean thousands of
instances of data, NLTK to tokenize and perform stemming and lemmatization processing. This is a project of its own, separate from the next one.

• Utilized FastText for training word-embedding models, created my own word-embedding model to test against and
used the best models to power a small-scale AI job listings application for classifying job descriptions.
